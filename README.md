## Usage

### EQ Controls

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Drag slider **up** | Boost frequency (orange, up to +12dB) |
| Drag slider **down** | Cut frequency (blue, down to -12dB) |
| Center position | No change (0dB) |
| Toggle switch | Enable/disable EQ processing |

### Audio vs EQ Toggles

- **Audio toggle**: Enables or bypasses the entire chain (headroom + EQ + output stages)
- **EQ toggle**: Bypasses only EQ filters while keeping the rest of the chain active

This makes it easier to run quick A/B checks without losing gain staging.

### Real-time Visual Monitoring

- **Response graph**: Shows the computed frequency response of your active band/filter setup
- **Spectrum analyzer**: Shows live post-EQ spectrum activity in real time

Use both together to correlate what you hear with what the processing is doing.

### Advanced Parametric Controls

Each band includes additional controls under the slider:

- **Filter type menu**: Peak, LS, HS, LP, HP, Notch, BP
- **Frequency field**: Set exact center/cutoff frequency (20Hz to 20kHz)
- **Q field**: Set bandwidth/resonance for precise shaping
- **Band add/remove controls**: Add a new band, remove the last band, or remove an individual band

### Presets

- **Select Preset**: Use the dropdown menu to choose built-in or custom presets
- **Save Custom**: Click **+** to save current EQ settings
- **Delete Custom**: Click trash icon (only available for custom presets)
- **Reset**: Click Reset button to return all bands to 0dB

### Launch at Login

Check the "Launch at Login" box to have SoundMaxx start automatically when you log in. This setting is managed through macOS Login Items.

### Per-Device Profiles

SoundMaxx automatically remembers your EQ settings for each output device:

1. **First time with a device**: Adjust your EQ settings and click "Save Profile"
2. **Returning to a device**: Your saved EQ enabled state, bands, and volume are automatically restored
3. **After saving once**: Further changes are auto-saved to that device profile
4. **HDMI displays**: A software volume slider appears since macOS disables hardware volume control for HDMI

This is perfect for users who switch between headphones, speakers, and HDMI displays with different audio characteristics.

You can delete a saved device profile at any time from the profile controls row.

### Quick Output Device Shortcut

Use the global shortcut **Control+Option+Command+O** to jump to the next available output device without opening the app UI.

- By default, it cycles through all outputs
- In the **Targets** menu, you can limit cycling to specific outputs (for example: speakers + headphones only)
- Shortcut switches also update your saved output device selection

### Latency & Buffer Controls

SoundMaxx uses a three-stage buffering pipeline to balance latency and stability. All controls are in **Advanced Options → Latency**.

| Control | Range | Effect |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| **I/O Buffer** | 64–4096 frames | How often audio is processed per callback. Lower = less latency, higher CPU pressure. |
| **Ring Capacity** | 1×–16× | Internal buffer space (multiple of I/O buffer). Higher = more stable, more latency tolerance. |
| **Target Queue** | 1×–ring capacity | Keeps the ring buffer near this depth, trimming older frames to prevent A/V drift. |

The **Effective** readout shows the actual frame sizes negotiated with your audio hardware (devices may clamp to supported values).

**Recommended starting points:**

| Profile | I/O Buffer | Ring Capacity | Target Queue |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Balanced (default) | 256 | 4× | 2× |
| Low Latency | 64–128 | 2–4× | 1–2× |
| Maximum Stability | 512–1024 | 6–8× | 3–4× |

- **Hearing crackles / pops** → increase I/O buffer or ring capacity
- **Audio feels delayed** → decrease I/O buffer or target queue
- **Audio drifts out of sync** → lower target queue
- **Unstable when switching devices** → increase ring capacity
- HDMI and Bluetooth outputs typically need higher buffer sizes

Changing these settings briefly restarts the audio engine.

### Import AutoEQ Text Files

In addition to browsing AutoEQ inside the app, you can import downloaded AutoEQ text files:

1. Click the **import icon** next to the preset and AutoEQ buttons
2. Select an AutoEQ `ParametricEQ.txt` file (or `GraphicEQ.txt`)
3. SoundMaxx parses and applies the curve to your current EQ

This is useful when sharing tuned files or testing custom AutoEQ exports.

### AutoEQ Headphone Correction

SoundMaxx integrates with the [AutoEQ](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq) project to provide scientifically-measured frequency response corrections for popular headphones.

1. Click the **headphones icon** (🎧) next to the preset menu
2. Search for your headphones or browse the list
3. Click to apply the correction curve
4. Your EQ is automatically adjusted to flatten your headphone's frequency response

**Included headphones (150+):**
- Over-ear: Sennheiser HD 560S/600/650/800, Beyerdynamic DT 770/880/990, Sony WH-1000XM4/XM5, Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, HiFiMAN Sundara/Ananda/Edition XS, Focal Utopia/Clear, AKG, Meze, Audeze
- In-ear: Apple AirPods Pro/Pro 2, Sony WF-1000XM4/XM5, Samsung Galaxy Buds, Shure SE series, Moondrop (Aria/Chu/Kato/KXXS), Etymotic ER2/ER4, 7Hz, Tin HiFi, KZ, Truthear, FiiO
- Gaming: HyperX Cloud II, SteelSeries Arctis, Razer BlackShark, Logitech G Pro
- On-ear: Koss Porta Pro/KPH40, Grado SR series

The correction curves are fetched from the AutoEQ database and converted to our 10-band format.

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Output

1. Verify BlackHole is set as system output in System Settings → Sound
2. Check SoundMaxx shows "Running" status (green indicator)
3. Ensure the correct output device is selected in SoundMaxx
4. Try clicking Stop, then Start again

### No Sound from Specific Apps

Some apps have their own audio output settings. Check the app's preferences and ensure it's using "System Default" or "BlackHole 2ch" as output.

### "Microphone Access" Prompt

SoundMaxx requires microphone permission to capture audio from BlackHole. This is a macOS security requirement for any app that reads audio input.

- Click **Allow** when prompted
- If previously denied: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Enable SoundMaxx

### App Won't Open (Blocked by macOS)

For unsigned builds, macOS Gatekeeper may block the app:

1. Right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**
2. Or: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Click **Open Anyway**

### Audio Crackling or Dropouts

- Close other audio-intensive applications
- Try a different output device
- Check Audio MIDI Setup to ensure sample rates match (44.1kHz or 48kHz)

### Sample Rate Mismatch Errors

SoundMaxx attempts to match sample rates automatically. If issues persist:

1. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (in /Applications/Utilities)
2. Set both BlackHole and your output device to the same sample rate
3. Restart SoundMaxx

## Building a Release

```bash
./scripts/build-release.sh
```

This creates a DMG installer in the `build/` directory.

## Publishing to GitHub Releases

Use the publish script to build and upload the latest DMG to GitHub Releases.

Prerequisites:

```bash
brew install gh
```

### Configure with `.env` (Recommended)

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Common fields:

- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (for example `brimell/SoundMax`)
- `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional if `gh auth login` is already set up)
- `RELEASE_TAG`, `RELEASE_TITLE`, `RELEASE_NOTES`
- `RELEASE_SKIP_BUILD=true` if you want upload-only by default

Then run:

```bash
./scripts/publish-release.sh
```

Optional: use a different env file:

```bash
./scripts/publish-release.sh --env-file .env.release
```

### CLI + Auth Notes

You can authenticate either by:

- Running `gh auth login`, or
- Providing `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your `.env`

Default usage (build + upload):

```bash
./scripts/publish-release.sh
```

Useful options:

```bash
# Upload an already-built DMG
./scripts/publish-release.sh --skip-build

# Override release metadata
./scripts/publish-release.sh --tag v1.0.1 --title "SoundMaxx v1.0.1" --notes "Release notes here"

# Publish to a specific repository
./scripts/publish-release.sh --repo brimell/SoundMaxx
